# Hey!
I am a 20-year-old University Student aspiring to be a Software Developer.
I love working on big projects, working on UI, and studying Design.


I have worked in the past with C, C++, C#, Java and Kotlin. 
I have developed web apps using Java, HTML, PHP and MySQL.
I am currently learning Android Development using Kotlin.
